# Latex Template #
This is an awesome template for you to use for writing reports.
It has a snazzy title page, a table of contents, a main section,
and room for Appendices.

# Usage #
Open it in your favourite Latex editor. Add stuff. Compile it with
XeLaTex, twice. I used TexShop with MacTex packages on a Mac.

# Notes #
If you're not at the University of Edinburgh, you might want to change
the logo on the title page to something a bit more appropriate.

You'll also need the fonts that are installed as standard on a Mac:
Minion Pro for the general text, and Menlo as monospace.

Do what you like with it, but keep it open source and attributed!
I think thats CC-attribute-sharealike or something. I'll fix this up
when I have internet and aren't on a train.
